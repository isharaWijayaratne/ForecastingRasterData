# **Forecasting Evapotranspiration for Raster Data**
---

This is an R-based predictive model for estimating evapotranspiration in raster data, implementing the Hargreaves method in a spatially explicit format. This required advanced raster layer computations, efficiently executed using the **terra** package in RStudio. By automating the process, I enhanced the accuracy and scalability of evapotranspiration forecasting, making it more accessible for geospatial and environmental analysis.
